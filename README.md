# advent-of-code

A collection of my solutions to Advent of Code challenges.

I usually complete this to demonstrate what a Go solution would look like as a
contrast to my friend's solutions in other languages like Javascript or Python.
Sometimes, I've been given additional constraints, which may lead to what looks
like some suboptimal solutions, so I wouldn't take this as a shining example
of what my engineering looks like. For that, I'd suggest checking out some of
my other repositories.
